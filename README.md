# NasaApp
  - When running the program on a browser there might be a delay trying to retrieve the image of the day since the api has to change images due to the date changing.
# Images Folder
  - The image folder contains a default image for the site if there is no image of the day posted.
# Master Folder
  - index.html: contains bootstrap and is the default page if the load.js page is not loaded in.
  - main.css: handles media queries to make sure the page is responsive.
  - load.js: includes ajax to connect to the api and loads the home page with the image of the day.
  - main.js: contains the functionality of the search-bar and gets information from the api.
